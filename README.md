# CNN Model for MNIST dataset
The *MNIST dataset* consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0-9, each of 28x28 pixels.<br />
This project consists of a *LeNet* CNN model built to classify the images of the dataset.

The __cnnmodel__ consits of the model itself in __CNNmmnist.ipynb__ and checkpoints in __cnnmodels/temp/train/checkpoint__ .<br />
Similarly, the saved weights are stored in __cnnmodel/temp/train/models/weights.h5__ .<br />

The __flask__ folder consists of __app.py__ with the flask app and __architecture.py__ consisting of the LeNet Architecture.
